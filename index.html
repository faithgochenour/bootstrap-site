        Work that paint. Anyone can paint. Nothing wrong with washing your
        brush. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy.
        That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and
        I can make this world as happy as I want it. As trees get older they
        lose their chlorophyll.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. All you need
        is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. A fan brush is a
        fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Only eight
        colors that you need. It is a lot of fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Poor old tree.
        The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it
        finished in your mind before you ever start.
      </p>

      <p>
        I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's
        okay though; I have more fun than most people. But they're very easily
        killed. Clouds are delicate. It's important to me that you're happy.
      </p>

      <p>
        We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize
        it. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to
        this. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. Let your
        imagination be your guide. Everything's not great in life, but we can
        still find beauty in it.
